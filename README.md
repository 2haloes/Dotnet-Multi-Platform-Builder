# Dotnet-Multi-Platform-Builder
A simple command-line tool for release building


# Hello world!

I'm creating this basic tool to make my own build process quicker but I'll do what I can to make this both dynamic and easy to use

While I'd usually make a program with a GUI, this doesn't really need one and the extra work wouldn't really be worth it

This was created in response to the fact that my big C# project is a pain to export and this would make it a lot easier to do

I'll do my best to support all of the command line options but I'll have to look into that a bit more to see if this can update itself when new versions and options are added

I will also add an asset downloader if the release uses something form the internet (A feature I'd use which is probably why I'm making it)
